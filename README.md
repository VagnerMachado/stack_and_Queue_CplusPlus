Name: Vagner Machado    
Due date: Soft copy:  2/4/2019 Monday before midnight    
                  Hard copy:  2/5/2019 Tuesday in class     

<b>Algorithm Steps for the Program 1:</b> 
*Step 1:* Ask the user to select class types:     
			Stack or Queue to do operation             
	S - for stack     
	Q - for Queue     
*Step 2:* Output to console the user's class selection   
*Step 3:* Ask the user to select methods: insertion or deletion    
	I - for insertion    
	D - for deletion    
*Step 4:* Output to console the user's method selection   
*Step 5:* 5.1: Ask the user for an input    
	   5.2: Output to console the user's input	    
*Step 6:*    
6.1: create a new node for the user's input   
	   6.2: Perform the methods of the user's choices (class and operation)   
*Step 7:* call print method to output the result of the operation    
*Step 8:* Ask the user if he/she wants to do another operation:   
	Y - for yes   
	N - for no    
*Step 9:* output to the console the user's choice yes or no    
*Step 10:* if the user enter N    
	   exit program   
	else   
		 repeat step 3 to step 10
